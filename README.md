# Python Learning Repository

This repository contains Python code written for learning and practice purposes.

It includes exercises, small projects, and experimental scripts created to explore Python fundamentals, reinforce core programming concepts, and gradually build problem-solving skills.

## 📌 Purpose

The main goal of this repository is:

* Practice Python syntax and logic
* Apply concepts such as variables, conditionals, loops, functions, data structures, and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
* Experiment with small console-based applications
* Track personal progress while learning Python

The code may evolve over time and can include multiple versions of similar solutions as part of the learning process.

## 🧠 What You’ll Find Here

* Basic Python exercises
* Small practice projects (CLI-based)
* Exploratory and experimental code
* Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) examples and exercises
* Refactors and improvements over time

Some files may contain comments, print statements, or simplified logic intentionally kept for learning and debugging purposes.

## ⚠️ Notes

* This repository is **not intended for production use**
* Some code may be repetitive or non-optimized by design
* The focus is on learning, not perfection

## 🚀 Continuous Learning

As learning progresses, this repository also includes Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as classes, objects, constructors, attributes, and basic modeling principles.

This repository will be updated as new topics are studied and new exercises are completed, serving as a personal learning log and reference for future projects.
